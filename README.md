# Spark
Spark is a programming language project I'm working on to entertain myself.
This project is purely a hobby project, which will most likely be abandoned within a few weeks.

I'm using the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) book as a "Getting Started" guide,
but the idea is to eventually attempt to compile Spark down to Assembly code as I also have an interest in learning
more about machine code.

## Long-term Goals
Even though I know I'm likely going to abandon this project somewhat quickly, I figured I'd note down
my long term goals for the project.

- Make the language statically typed (I generally speaking dislike dynamically typed languages)
- Write a compiler that will turn the bytecode representation into assembly instructions
